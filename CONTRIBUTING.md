# Contributing to PDFTron - React Native

## Issues
1. Check existing issues (open/closed) to avoid duplicates.
2. Be clear about what the problem is.
3. Make sure to paste error output or logs.
4. Code snapshot or demos on online code editor will be very helpful.

## Pull requests
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a branch from `dev`.
3. Update the source code (in `*.ts` files).
4. Commit and push the changes with descriptive messages.
5. Create a pull request to `dev`.

\* Please note that all pull requests should be tied to an issue, and all but the most trivial pull requests should be discussed beforehand.
\*\* Changes made to `dev` will automatically be applied to `master`. For more detailed information on developing post-TypeScript migration, see the [wiki](https://github.com/PDFTron/pdftron-react-native/wiki).

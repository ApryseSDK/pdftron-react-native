# PDFTron React Native API

PDFTron's React Native PDF Library allows applications to use JavaScript to build cross-platform mobile apps. 

The application UI is rendered using native views to provide users the fluid look and feel of traditional native applications.

## TypeScript

Starting with version 3.0.0, PDFTron React Native provides support for TypeScript! 

For TypeScript users, type information is automatically provided while coding. They can also be found in our [TypeScript source files](https://github.com/PDFTron/pdftron-react-native/tree/master/src).

The typings used in these API docs will be described using normal JavaScript types.

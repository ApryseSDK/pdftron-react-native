# PDFTron React Native API

PDFTron's React Native PDF Library allows applications to use JavaScript to build cross-platform mobile apps. 

The application UI is rendered using native views to provide users the fluid look and feel of traditional native applications.

## TypeScript

Starting with version 3.0.0, PDFTron React Native provides support for TypeScript! 

For TypeScript users, type information is automatically provided while coding. Exact type aliases and constants used in our custom typings can also be found in our [TypeScript source files](https://github.com/PDFTron/pdftron-react-native/tree/master/src).

The typings used in these API docs will be described using normal JavaScript types. 

## Frequently used

- {@link Config} - Defines configuration constants for the viewer.
- {@link DocumentView} - An all-in-one React component for displaying and editing documents of different types.
- {@link RNPdftron} - Contains static methods for global library initialization, configuration, and utility methods.

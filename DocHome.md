# PDFTron React Native API

## TypeScript

PDFTron React Native now has support for TypeScript. Since not all customers use the language, the typings used in this document will be described using normal JavaScript types. For TypeScript users, type information is automatically provided while coding. They can also be found in our [TypeScript source files](src).
